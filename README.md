Here, we get each player and team performances
There is a function which takes the input as player name which gives player overall performance in IPL i.e. batting as well bowling performances
Also there is another function which takes team name as input parameter which returns team overall performance in IPL
Make sure that, since here this data contains only upto 2017 IPL we get information upto 2017 IPL details only. If you have source to get data upto present IPL deliveries data then please suggest me at kvravisagar96@gmail.com or comment on this repository.
